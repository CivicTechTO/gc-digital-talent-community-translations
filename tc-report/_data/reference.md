  - This section describes our most commonly used methods of collecting data, the types of data that we collected, how we used it, and some important constraints to consider, particularly when interpreting our research questions. It also looks at how we arrive at our research questions to begin with, and what we do with our research findings.

    title: sample
    content: We don’t want to oversell our findings. We’re a small scale experiment and we don’t have a statistically sound sample size for running randomized control trials. While we’re cross-referencing external research with our quantitative and qualitative findings, our research results should be considered weak signals, not definitive solutions.
