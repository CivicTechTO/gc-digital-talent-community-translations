    title: About the Indigenous Talent Portal
    aboutContent:
      - The Indigenous Talent Portal was built for the Indigenous community, by the Indigenous community. It is a platform designed to host employment opportunities for Indigenous peoples in a way that recognizes and lets them showcase their unique value.
      - Using the portal, Indigenous talent will be able to create reusable profiles for job applications and the option to make the profile searchable by Government of Canada managers. The portal is also designed to ensure that Indigenous community members can share their stories according to their own teachings and beliefs.
      - With the portal connected to the larger talent ecosystem, users of the Indigenous Talent Portal can also apply to and get found for other IT jobs in the Government of Canada.
