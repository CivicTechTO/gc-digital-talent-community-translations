  - Rethinking job requirements in the form of required skills is the biggest single impact we can recommend to improve diversity and inclusion. But to do this successfully, the application system design must also guide applicants to formulate their skills claims in a way that managers and HR advisors can value. Otherwise, the whole intervention will fail.

  - "Show, don’t tell, when it comes to making people feel included. Instead of motherhood statements on inclusion and diversity, we recommend:"

    style: unordered
    items:
      - Messaging aimed at user groups that includes concrete examples of how a product or team is working towards more inclusive results.
      - A pleasant accessible experience that does more than meet the minimum requirements.
      - Wording and grammar choices that are GBA+ sensitive and plain language, making content more accessible for people of different genders and linguistic groups, and those with varying levels of access to advanced education. 
      - Products and platforms showcasing colours and images that have meaning for equity-seeking groups.
      - Sensitivity towards the complex relationship between the Government of Canada and Indigenous communities, and the way in which Government branding and imagery can evoke associations for Indigenous users that are not the same as associations made by other user groups.
      - User testing with diverse communities, and honouring the results of that testing with changes, as required.

  - We recommend crafting diversity and inclusion initiatives that have both “heart” and “teeth” - building an equality-driven future together, while taking concrete action to acknowledge and address existing systemic inequalities.
