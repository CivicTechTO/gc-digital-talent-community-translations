  - When Talent Cloud first launched the platform in 2018, our initial hiring processes took ~130 days to identify the top applicant, plus ~60 days to complete security clearance and finalize HR paperwork. This was right in line with the Government of Canada average at the time. By the time the experiment wrapped, our average time to identify the top applicant was down to ~40 days, plus security clearance. And our fastest processes came in at ~20 days, plus security clearance.
  - So how does a manager go from taking ~130 days to find a candidate to ~20 days? Some steps that save time overlap with each other, and some interventions have wide ranges in how much time they can potentially save. Splitting the credit for time saved in places where these interventions chronologically overlap, hereâ€™s our best (and very rough) estimate of how our platform interventions added up to ~110 days saved.
  - "One important reminder: all this data comes from competitive, externally advertised jobs."
