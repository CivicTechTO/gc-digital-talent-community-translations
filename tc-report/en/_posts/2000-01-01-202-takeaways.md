  - To optimize the match between an applicant and a project-based job opportunity, managers should look to the specifics of the role (impact and key tasks), rather than to generic text associated more broadly with the classification of the job. Project-based work is less about filling vacancies in the organization and more about addressing gaps in delivering specific time-delineated work, often in high priority areas. Shifting from a broad job advertisement to one tailored to the role will aid in optimizing hiring outcomes for project-based opportunities (and aids in speeding time to staff).

  - Factoring in the work environment, team culture and manager leadership style into the job advertisement and the job requirements makes a significant difference in creating a strong match between the chosen applicant(s) and their new team.

  - Authenticity and self-awareness are important assets for managers in the hiring process. Managers have more success attracting high-performing applicants who are a strong fit to their teams if they are accurate in their self-assessment of the work environment and team culture. If managers are self-aware and authentic in their representation of these elements when designing the job advertisement, our data suggests that they are more likely to attract applicants who will have the soft skills needed to succeed in the job and the work environment. Applicants are also more attracted to apply for job advertisements where they feel the manager profiles reflect authenticity, rather than perfection or generic government statements on values and priorities.
