    label: Vision for the Future
  - Talent Cloud imagines a future for the Government of Canada where...
  - type: list
    style: ordered
    items:
      - Government will be able to secure as much high performing talent as it needs to advance the digital government agenda, including recruiting those with rare, in-demand, and emerging digital age skills
      - The talent engine will be able to recognize and support the upskilling of those with greater potential
      - The fit between the incoming talent and the team will be optimized to the work environment and organizational culture, ensuring rapid onboarding, strong performance, and high productivity
      - Project-based work will be fully supported by the government’s talent model, including rapid team assembly to support new priorities in a fast evolving ecosystem
      - Talent will be able to move in and out of government easily, with their credentials recognized and portable between organizations
      - More citizens will have a chance to work for the Government of Canada on project-based opportunities at some point in their careers, promoting a richer diversity of ideas inside government and increasing citizen awareness of government operations
      - The talent engine that supports digital government will be a strong, ethical system that supports workers’ right and benefits for “gig” or project-based work
      - The talent engine will support not only increased representation, but also the advancement of meaningful equality for all those in Canada who are underrepresented in the current government talent ecosystem (including tackling anti-racism and inclusion priorities such as visibility, narrative ownership, safety and support, and equal influence to define and occupy positions of influence and authority)

    label: Project Vision
  - (July 2017 – March 2021)
  - Talent Cloud’s vision is to create a talent engine that can move as swiftly as needed to ensure that the Government of Canada has access to all the digital talent it needs for project-based work. Talent hired will have access to union representation, pension, rights, and benefits. The talent engine will be designed in such a way that it illuminates the skills and stories of those who are underrepresented and unseen, and will encourage hiring authorities to place value on these experiences, leading to greater diversity in hiring outcomes and a hiring experience for all that is validating. Driven by portable digital credentials, the talent engine will bring a rich set of data on the skills ecosystem available to the Government of Canada, allowing for more optimized recruitment and mobility targeting existing gaps and emerging priorities.

    label: Mission
  - (July 2017 – March 2021)
  - Develop and test bold new recruitment and mobility approaches for digital talent in the Government of Canada, respecting fundamental principles that promote workers' rights, embrace user experience design and Digital Standards, and advance equity, inclusion and diversity.

    label: Mandate
  - (July 2017 – March 2021)
  - As an experimental platform run by the Digital Change Sector in the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Talent Cloud has a mandate to help ensure that the Government of Canada has the digital talent it needs to deliver on government priorities and commitments to Canadians. This means helping to ensure that high performing talent, with in-demand digital skills, is available when needed. Working with partner departments who have the authority to staff on a hiring platform of their choice (assuming links to the job advertisement are also posted to GCJobs), Talent Cloud has a mandate to explore issues that are preventing partner departments from getting the digital talent they need, and to work collaboratively towards potential solutions through testing and research.
