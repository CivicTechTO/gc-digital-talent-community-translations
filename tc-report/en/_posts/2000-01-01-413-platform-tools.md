    alt: "A graphic representing how Talent Cloud builds its platform tools. The process involves four steps, and while the process can be linear from step 1 through 4, the graphic contains various faded arrows that indicate that the process involves returning to previous steps where required to ensure the tool meets user needs. The first step is planning the tool, where workshops, journey mapping, and interviews take place. This is where we build hypothetical tools using whiteboards, paper, or digital prototypes, and ask managers and applicants to use the tools in mock processes. The second step is live, low-fidelity testing. This is where paper prototypes become Excel and Microsoft Word documents and get used for real job processes. Managers and HR advisors use these tools off-platform to test their usefulness and refine how our theory of change connects to practical realities of actual staffing. This step indicates that the team might return to step one (planning) if tests indicate it is necessary. The third step is first round platform testing, where feature designs from workshops and off-platform testing finally get coded and make it into portals. For applicants, most tools get introduced and tested here first for live processes. For managers and HR advisors, new tools on their portals have usually gone through several rounds of live, off-platform development. This step indicates that the team might return to step two (live, low-fidelity testing) if necessary to better understand the feature. The fourth and final step is upgraded platform tools, where the big things become \"permanent\" parts of the platform. However, there are always refinements that we only learn about from live testing. In some cases, entire tools are rebuilt to deliver better behavioural or process results. The tools on our platform are also interconnected, so no matter how great a tool is when it's released, it still needs to be updated when other tools are changed or added. This step indicates the team might return to step three (first round platform testing) or even step two (live, low-fidelity testing) if the research demands it."
