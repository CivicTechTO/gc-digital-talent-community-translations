  - GC experts identified that some delays in security screening were caused by applicant errors made on the clearance forms, resulting in processing issues and forms having to be resubmitted. Users have reported that they found the forms confusing and prone to errors during our research. Since only an original copy with signature was accepted by security officials, and secure methods of delivery were required, candidates often needed to mail the paper copy to the security office. One can imagine how the process could slow down if the error was only detected by the time the mail reached the department, and the candidate needed to complete and submit (by mail) a new form. In some cases, forms went from applicants to managers to HR to security, only to travel this chain of transmission in reverse when an error was detected.

  - While Talent Cloud has no mandate for security clearance modernization, the team worked with the Security Policy Team at Treasury Board Secretariat to design a prototype of a digital Reliability security form. The prototype was front-end only, meaning it was not linked to any database in the background for real-use.

  - In collaboration, the prototype was tested to determine if the digital form would help guide applicants to provide the correct information and if the code would correctly check for errors in real-time before submission. The digital reliability clearance form prototype demonstrated that an interactive form could support users in providing the correct information. Users also commented on the intuitiveness of the interface compared to the paper form, which helped them to navigate the requirements and provide information in a correct format.
  - Security screening is an important security measure for the Government of Canada. The Talent Cloud team appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with the Security Policy team to build and test the digital reliability clearance form prototype. The prototype has been transferred to the responsible authority for their consideration.

Errors are placed in helpful locations where gaps in the applicant's address information exist."
