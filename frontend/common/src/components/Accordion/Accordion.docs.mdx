# Accordion

> A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content.

This is a styled version of [@radix-ui/accordion](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/accordion). The one exception is that we conviently combine `Header` in the `Trigger` and add some addional props for styling.

## Subcomponents

 - `Accordion.Root`
 - `Accordion.Item`
 - `Accordion.Trigger`
 - `Accordion.Content`

## Usage

There are two main types of `Accordion` which are defined by the `type` prop. Those are, single and multiple.

### Single

This type only allows one `Accordion.Item` to be open at once and will close the current open item when another is opened.

```tsx
import Accordion from "@common/components/Accordion";

const ExampleAccordionSingleOpen = () => (
  <Accordion.Root type="single">
    <Accordion.Item value="one">
        <Accordion.Trigger Icon={HeroIcon} subtitle="Subtitle">
          Example Accordion One Heading
        </Accordion.Trigger>
        <Accordion.Content>
          <p>Example accordion one content.
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

### Multiple

This type allows any number of `Accordion.Item` to be open at once.

```tsx
import Accordion from "@common/components/Accordion";

const ExampleAccordionMultipleOpen = () => (
  <Accordion.Root type="multiple">
    <Accordion.Item value="one">
      <Accordion.Trigger Icon={HeroIcon} subtitle="Subtitle">
        Example Accordion One Heading
      </Accordion.Trigger>
      <Accordion.Content>
        <p>Example accordion one content.
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Item value="two">
      <Accordion.Trigger Icon={HeroIcon} subtitle="Subtitle">
        Example Accordion Two Heading
      </Accordion.Trigger>
      <Accordion.Content>
        <p>Example accordion two content.
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```
