# Uncomment the two envvars below to test the redirect flow with
# mock-oauth2-server. Without these, the single login integration test
# ("successfully logs in as existing admin user") won't run. This is due to how
# Cypress works in an iframe, and so Laravel will refuse to load the session
# during redirect back to app.
